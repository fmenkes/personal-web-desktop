# Personal Web Desktop

This is an examination exercise I made for my BSc at Linn√©universitet, a Personal Web Desktop written in JavaScript with Node. Please see the examination folder for contents, or visit http://fmenkes.github.io/personal-web-desktop to see it in action (may need to refresh a few times to make navbar buttons work).
